## Features
- Store vehicle details (Brand, Model, Price)
- Use private data members for security
- Getter and Setter methods to access and update values
- Display vehicle information using a separate method
- Update vehicle price dynamically

## Technologies Used
- Java
- OOP Concepts

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Class and Object
- Constructor
- Encapsulation
- Getter and Setter Methods
- Method Calling
- Data Abstraction Basics

## How It Works
1. Two Vehicle objects are created with initial values.
2. The price of one vehicle is updated using a setter method.
3. Updated vehicle details are displayed using `displayVehicleDetails()`.

## How to Run
1. Save the file as `Solution.java`.
2. Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
